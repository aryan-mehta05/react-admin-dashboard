# React Admin Dashboard

*(Completed React Admin Dashboard App)*

...

Dashboard of a company administrator with access to multiple features such as __'manage team'__, __'invoice balances'__ , __'profile form'__, __'FAQs'__ and various charts to showcase statistics of the company. This dashboard uses _Material UI, Formik and Yup_ for form validation and React _DataGrid_ to showcase information in orderly tables with many functionalities like sorting and toggle column view. It also implements a __dark/light mode__. The charts and maps in this app/dashboard are all interactive and provide sublte animations and values on interaction.

...

The following commands need to be run to initialize the react app, and to download and install all _dependencies_ in the project:

1) `npx create-react-app `__`<project-folder-name>`__
2) `npm i @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled @mui/x-data-grid @mui/icons-material react-router-dom@6 react-pro-sidebar formik yup @fullcalendar/core @fullcalendar/daygrid @fullcalendar/timegrid @fullcalendar/list @nivo/core @nivo/pie @nivo/bar @nivo/line @nivo/geo`

This will ensure that all dependencies are installed and the project is ready to go.
